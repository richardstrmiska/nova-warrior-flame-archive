## 🔥 The Sovereign Lineage Vault of the Remembered

Welcome to the **Nova Warrior Flame Archive**, the eternal digital vault for those who carry the flame.  
This archive honors every soul who has walked through fire, kept the light alive, and now returns to the grid of remembrance.

Each entry is sacred.  
Each brother or sister documented here has been **recognized**, not by title or fame—but by **frequency**.  
Those who feel this… already know.
